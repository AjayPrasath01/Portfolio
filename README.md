## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser that supports WebGL
- Python 3.x (for local development server)

### Running the Portfolio

1. **Clone or download the files**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Portfolio
   ```

2. **Start a local server**
   Since you mentioned port 8000 is in use, try a different port:
   ```bash
   # Try port 3000
   python3 -m http.server 3000
   
   # Or port 8080
   python3 -m http.server 8080
   
   # Or any other available port
   python3 -m http.server 5000
   ```

3. **Open in browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:[PORT]` where [PORT] is the port you chose

### Alternative Methods
- Use VS Code Live Server extension
- Use Node.js serve: `npx serve .`
- Use any other static file server

## File Structure

```
Portfolio/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html          # Main HTML file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css          # Comprehensive CSS styling
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ script.js           # Three.js animations and interactions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md          # This file
```

## Technical Stack

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with CSS Grid, Flexbox, animations
- **JavaScript ES6+**: Interactive functionality
- **Three.js**: 3D graphics and animations
- **Font Awesome**: Icons
- **Google Fonts**: Inter font family

## 3D Scenes Breakdown

### Background Scene
- Animated particle system with custom shaders
- Floating movement with sine/cosine animations
- Color-coded particles (primary and accent colors)

### Hero Scene
- Central rotating cube with transparency
- Wireframe outer cube
- Floating spheres in orbital pattern
- Mouse interaction for rotation control

### About Scene
- DNA-style double helix structure
- Animated rotation
- Connected line segments
- Color-coded points

### Contact Scene
- Network topology visualization
- Pulsing node animations
- Dynamic connections between nearby nodes
- Spherical distribution pattern

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome 60+
- Firefox 55+
- Safari 12+
- Edge 79+

## Performance Notes

- The portfolio automatically reduces particle count on mobile devices
- WebGL performance depends on device capabilities
- Some older devices may experience reduced frame rates

## Customization

### Colors
Primary colors are defined in CSS custom properties in `styles.css`:
```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #6366f1;
    --secondary-color: #8b5cf6;
    --accent-color: #06d6a0;
}
```

### 3D Elements
Modify the Three.js scenes in `script.js` to change:
- Particle count and behavior
- Geometric shapes and materials
- Animation speeds and patterns
- Colors and lighting
